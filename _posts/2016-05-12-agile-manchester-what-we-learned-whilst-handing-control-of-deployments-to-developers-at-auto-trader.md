This is a tweaked version of a presentation I [first did at Devops Edinburgh](2015-12-07-devops-edinburgh-how-we-put-developers-in-control-of-deployments-at-auto-trader). Here are the slides for my talk, which covers

* Auto Trader’s deployment history
* Our project which delivered control of deployment to developers
* What we learned from the experience
* Our in-progress product which will be the future of deployment at Auto Trader (probably not covered in the actual presentation as I talk too much)
