Static analysis has been a widely used tool in development teams for some time now. So when I saw this tweet about [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) I was very interested. I‚Äôve looked for some wisdom about shell scripting best practices in the past, and not found much useful. Plus, [automating your coding standards](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Automate_Your_Coding_Standard) being one of the [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CC8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FThings-Every-Programmer-Should-Know%2Fdp%2F0596809484&ei=X3s9U_7YHrGV7Abns4DYDQ&usg=AFQjCNF6I5nBRCYnyAiIdatoviQRoeuWCA&sig2=U6wPuwGjIjF0xNQZXstVTw), perhaps a tool like this is much more valuable.

I use OS X so I am lucky enough to be able to install it locally. The [installation instructions](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#building-with-cabal) don‚Äôt mention Windows (although they do cover Debian & Fedora), so I‚Äôm gonna guess you‚Äôll struggle to get it working under something like Cygwin. In any case, there is an awesome UI on <http://www.shellcheck.net/> which will give you feedback on scripts you have pasted in, with [clickable links](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2086) to wiki pages explaining any wisdom which doesn‚Äôt seem obvious to you.

# OS X Installation

If you are using OS X you can install using (mostly) brew, but I ran into a few difficulties so I thought I‚Äôd include them here, in case I forget to contribute to the documentation.

These are the steps you should be able to use to install. There‚Äôs a more detailed walkthrough with some of the error messages I saw underneath.

    brew install cabal-install
    cabal update
    cabal install cabal-install
    cabal install syb
    git clone https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck.git
    cd shellcheck
    cabal install

Then stick `export PATH=$HOME/.cabal/bin:$PATH` in your .bash_profile (or similar) and you're done. Now you can run `shellcheck script/test/unit/TEST_compare-versions.sh` and get output like the below! I got many more problems reported, but I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd want to read them all‚Ä¶

```
‚Ä¶
In script/test/unit/TEST_compare-versions.sh line 60:
	successTestResult $TEST_NAME
                          ^-- SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting.
‚Ä¶
```

In fact that‚Äôs a great example of something that catches me out a lot. Also, the exit code will indicate an error, so you can even put this in you CI build to make sure you get fast feedback when you do something silly. The script can take a number of file arguments, and works with globbed paths. If any of the files specified have issues then the exit code will indicate this, so you just need to run something like `shellcheck *.sh` to see whether you have any problems.

It might even be a useful tool to make available to your continuous integration systems to provide fast feedback to developers working on shell scripts.

# Detailed Walkthrough

Install cabal

Next get the ShellCheck source

Try installing ShellCheck

```
mark.crossfield@Galactica-Actual Ô£ø ~/Documents/workspace $ cd shellcheck/

Then update cabal-install itself (probably should have run a brew update before running `brew install cabal-install`?)
