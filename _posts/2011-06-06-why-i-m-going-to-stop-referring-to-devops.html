<p>I've recently decided to stop using the term devops (along with swarming, and QA team) through frustration that all of the conversation around it is vague and unfocussed. Few really know what it means and as a result people have formed their own definitions. Worse, a substantial amount of resistance has built up toward this abstract concept.</p>
<p>For those of you who are scratching their heads, devops is a name people are using to describe the growing movement of collaboration between teams of developers and operational support departments.software.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly a number of people have struggled to rationalise how this concept impacts and affects their job.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that we've done a lot of talking about what devops is rather than setting goals.</p>
<p>When I see someone in our team working on something without a clear goal of delivering a quantifiable benefit (usually functionality) then I call it out and suggest that they would be much more focussed if they had a tangible goal to aim for. I find a lot of questions about how something should be done answer themselves when you keep returning to why you're doing it.</p>
<p>So I'm going to stop discussing this abstract concept. I'm not going to talk about whether it is a role or a behaviour or a mindset. I'm going to suggest that a team of people work together towards a common goal of deploying our software more regularly - once a day as a start, then five times a day and then twenty times a day.</p>
