We had the second [DevOps Manchester](http://www.devopsmanchester.co.uk/post/82020992924/announcing-our-first-two-speakers-on-monitoring) meet up on Tuesday 29th May at the new TechHub Manchester office, where the topic was Monitoring. Along with an excellent talk from [Steve Elliot](www.tegud.net) of Late Rooms on ELK Wrestling (where [ELK](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/) represents Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana), I presented Graphite and Friends.

Here are the slides.
