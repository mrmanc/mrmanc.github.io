We had the second [DevOps Manchester](http://www.devopsmanchester.co.uk/post/82020992924/announcing-our-first-two-speakers-on-monitoring) meet up on Tuesday 29th May at the new TechHub Manchester office, where the topic was Monitoring. Along with an excellent talk from [Steve Elliot](http://www.tegud.net) of Late Rooms on ELK Wrestling (where [ELK](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/) represents Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana), I presented Graphite and Friends. Here are the slides (and below are the links from the presentation since they aren’t clickable in the embedded version).

Update: I’m blown away by how popular these slides have been, so I will be fleshing them out with a full article at some point. That way you won’t have to guess the meanings of the points in the slides! Please check back soon.
