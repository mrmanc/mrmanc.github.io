The obligatory first post. I’ve got a few ideas in the pipeline for future posts, but with a busy June it may be some time before they materialise. I’m attending Velocity 2011 in San Francisco, then heading straight off to Glastonbury where I volunteer as a steward with Oxfam. With plenty of travel time I’m sure I’ll manage to post something soon.
