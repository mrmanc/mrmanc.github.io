I’m Mark, a developer/engineer working at [Auto Trader](http://www.autotrader.co.uk/) (why not [join us?](http://careers.autotrader.co.uk/)) where I’ve worked on a large CMS project, [deployment automation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}2016-05-12-agile-manchester-what-we-learned-whilst-handing-control-of-deployments-to-developers-at-auto-trader.html) and more recently on building the service that will be responsible for releasing all infrastructure and application changes to our cloud environment. I’ve learnt a lot from others in my current role and from other people’s blogs, and want to pay it back by sharing here. I’m quite interested in the theoretical side of software and the working environment, especially areas such as Kanban, Scrum, TDD and BDD.

I’m also becoming more and more interested in software architecture and code design / code quality. I’m learning the importance of naming, and the selection of the appropriate abstractions. Computer Science and my career as a developer has given me a fascination for language, and it’s relation with theoretical engineering. I’ve done my fair share of fault diagnostics, and have learn quite a lot of techniques this way. I’m interested in the culture of devops, although I’m keen to avoid the misconceptions which tend to follow that term around.

In my free time I’m a keen film goer, love to read and have a fairly varied taste in music. I [volunteer as a Festival steward with Oxfam](http://www.oxfam.org.uk/stewarding), working at large festivals over the summer such as Glastonbury, Latitude and Leeds Festival.
