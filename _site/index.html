      <p>We’ve been doing quite a bit of work improving our Go environment recently, and correcting one or two continuous integration anti patterns we’d introduced. I wanted to find a way to see the effect of these changes, and it occurred to me that it might be possible to use D3.js to build the view. I have had good use cases for graph diagrams in the past but got bored looking for a good way to draw them programatically. I’d even lazily fallen back on the <a href="http://console.neo4j.org/">Neo4J console</a> to program the graph and then visualise it (and amusingly I now see that that page is using D3.js behind the scenes).</p>

      <p>A colleague asked us recently to make sure we turn our monitors off overnight to save power. That’s all very well, but what should we do about our dashboard? We purposefully disable power saving to make sure that the display doesn’t turn off during the day, and since we never actually use it there would be nothing to wake it up! It turns out you can easily script this using Task Scheduler, which comes with Windows. You will need to download a tool called <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html">NirCmd</a>, which allows you to control your monitor from the command line (amongst many other things). You already have a command called powercfg to configure the other Power Saving options from the command line.</p>

I spend literally hours a week just trawling logs, often wanting to visualise what I’m seeing. Yes, I could faff with Splunk or something else expensive (yes, I know there is a free version), but sometimes I just want to know what a column of response times looks like.</p>

      <p>Okay, so my <a href="http://markisadeveloper.wordpress.com/2012/05/10/meet-graphite/">previous post</a> is a long overdue summary of how we are visualising application metrics using Graphite. We are writing custom Logster parsers which scan our log files and push interesting things into Graphite. This means that to get a new metric into Graphite we need to add it to our log files (unless it already exists), and adapt or create a python Logster parser to understand whatever we’ve logged. This parser then needs to be deployed to our server running logster and a graph built. The biggest blocker we’ve seen with this approach is the necessity for the engineer to understand how to write Python, where to find and test the Logster parsers, and how to deploy the parser to the Logster server. Personally, this means either doing the work myself or explaining the peculiarities of Python white space handling to yet another person. There must be a better way.</p>

They started with some questions: how many of us had access to our production logs (a reassuringly high amount), and how many of us could tell them how many hits our application was getting right now / how many hits it got this time last year.</p>

      <p>My relationship with Ant has had its ups and downs. I hate writing a build file in a language that I’m unfamiliar with, and finding that the language seems designed to encourage and hideous result. Recently however I felt I achieved something, successfully reducing the duration of our teams pre check in task task from three and a half minutes to only 24 seconds.</p>

      <p>Our team have often expressed in retrospectives that they feel they should rotate more often. In fact, the irregular rotation is often a theme when trying to get to the root cause of bad design decisions and lacking code architecture. In the spirit of self-organisation we have sought not to impose pair rotation on the team, instead encouraging them to retrospect on this themselves and come up with their own scheme. The only limitation we’ve given is that one of the developers should remain on the story in each swap, so that some context is retained.</p>

      <p>This is a simple one, but I’m quite pleased with it, and I don’t think it jumps out as an obvious tweak. Fuze (formally Azureus) is a great BitTorrent client, which has some great features like transcoding and subscriptions. I’ve previously had it configured to download everything from an RSS feed, which was built from my bookmarks in Mininova. But they don’t have so many torrents these days, and I wanted a set up which wasn’t dependent on one site.</p>
